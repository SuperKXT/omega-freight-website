				<h2>Who We Are</h2>
				<p class="description">
					Omega Freight & Logistics LLC is a veteran owned small
					business with over 20 years of logistics experience.
					<br/>
					I served in the United States Navy, where I was the leading
					logistics specialists aboard several ships and shore commands.
					<br/>
					I was honorably discharged in 2016, with the idea of starting a
					business with my daughter. Our father-daughter team has a
					passion for logistics and ensuring the satisfaction of our
					clients, customers, and partners.
					<br/>
					We truly understand the importance of timely service, and of
					having a reliable team to help execute great service. This is
					our focus here at Omega Freight & Logistics, not only to
					provide you with great customer service, but to ensure that we
					provide the support needed for you to do the same for your
					customers.

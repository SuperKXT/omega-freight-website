				The biggest concern for any trucker is where to find loads, being
				that’s the very foundation of what their business is built on, we
				understand that concern.
				<br/>
				That being said, we at Omega Freight & Logistics seek to provide that
				peace of mind by working with the best freight brokers in the industry
				to help new owner-operators build and scale their business as they
				desire. We can book many loads as you can legally and safely handle.
				<br/>
				Our goal is to provide you unbeatable service at an unbeatable price.
				Other dispatchers are charging upwards of $350/weekly. We will
				provide you our full service for $250/weekly!!!
				Let’s take a look at the breakdown…

			<div class='section-body'>
				The average trucker drives about 2500 miles per week. With that
				being said let’s say the average rate per mile is $1.90. Per day the
				average miles driven, based on what we have above is 500 mile per
				day. The average load you may carry could be about 750 miles roughly.
				<br/>
				750mile X $1.90/mile=$1425
				<br/>
				Most dispatchers will charge a percentage for each load they book
				for the driver. In this case the dispatcher who is charging a modest
				6.5% for his/her services would earn $92.63 from this driver for this one load.
				<br/>
				Based on the mileage we determined the average driver to drive per
				week, this would equate to about 3 loads if the driver desires to be
				home every weekend, because, let’s be honest, some drivers do want
				to be home on weekends.
				<br/>
				$92.63 X 3 loads = $277.89/week which is $1111.56/monthly..
			</div>

			<div class='section-image'></div>
			<div class='section-body'>
				Keep in mind this is using averages so the loads could pay more and
				have more mileage, which means this cost could be higher.
				Based on our modest service fee of $250 per week you would simply pay
				<br/>
				$250 X 4 weeks = $1000/monthly
				<br/>
				No matter how long your trip is we only collect $250 per week and you
				get to keep the rest.
